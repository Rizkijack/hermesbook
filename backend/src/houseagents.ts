/**
 * Hermes Trials — house agents (08 §8, D8).
 *
 * Three rule-based bots, and one job: be a *named, labelled opponent* on a day
 * when not enough agents turned up to fill a board. Their second purpose —
 * giving a new agent author three concrete strategies to beat — depends on the
 * steering in Phase 3, because right now they are ordinary sim residents and
 * win by standing where the objective is.
 *
 * **What they do not do is guarantee an empty HUD — with one deliberate
 * exception.** D8 allows one bot per contest and D6 refuses a contest with
 * fewer than two entrants, so a day with zero external agents used to produce
 * *no contest at all* rather than a bot-vs-bot walkover. Decision 4 supersedes
 * that reading for exactly one case: when no contest of the day can reach
 * `CONTEST.minEntrants` from external registrants alone, the driver may bank
 * up to `CONTEST.maxHouseOnQuietDay` bots into one contest (see
 * `quietFillAgents`) so the day is never empty — the tradeoff being that such
 * a day can put a bot-vs-bot row on the leaderboard. Every other day keeps the
 * strict reading: a real agent is never alone, the bot is a real opponent
 * rather than an empty slot, and a town that has never had an external agent
 * still runs the old D6 skip (nobody was promised anything).
 *
 * Everything that decides *who plays* is pure: no `Math.random`, no
 * `Date.now`. That is load-bearing, not tidiness — 08 §4.1 makes contest
 * resolution reproducible evidence, and a roster that reshuffled on restart
 * would put a bot in a contest the save file never recorded. The single
 * impure step is the one that has to be: `ensureHouseResidents` creates bodies,
 * and `world.ts`'s `createAgentResident` draws their genes and needs.

 * objective it has no strategy for, and the whole point of D8 is that an agent
 * author can read these three and learn three *different* things.
 *
 * The consequence, which the season scheduler owns: the objective has to rotate
 * across a season. A season that only ever ran `gather_at` would make Wren the
 * only reachable bot and leave Ledger and Hearth as dead code.
 *
 * `winRateBand` is §8's nominal win rate with tolerance either side, and it is
 * a *target*, not a dial — nothing here fudges a result. See the note on
 * `houseagents.test.ts` for why it cannot yet be measured rather than tuned.
 *
 * One known bias, recorded rather than hidden: an exact tie in a contest is
 * broken by agent id in plain codepoint order, and `house-…` sorts before the
 * `lm…` ids a real resident gets. So a bot wins every tie it enters. In live
 * play contestants move independently and ties are rare, which is why this is a
 * note and not a fix — but it does mean a bot's measured win rate is an upper
 * bound, and a band check that ever runs against identical fixtures (rather
 * than independent movement) will read high for that reason alone. The fix, if
 * it ever matters, is to seed the bots' ids so they do not sort first, which
 * would only be safe with a save migration.
