/**
 * Hermes Trials — contest resolution (08 §4).
 *
 * The whole module is deliberately pure: every entry point takes a sample
 * array and returns a result. Nothing here reads the world, so the entire
 * competitive layer can be tested from hand-written fixtures without a running
 * sim (08 §13), and the samples double as the evidence the Daily Spit cites.
 *
 * The four objectives in 08 §4.2 collapse onto three shapes:
 *   - `gather_at` / `tend_project` → presence at a target (shared `presenceCards`)
 *   - `hold_ground`                → longest unbroken spell *alone* at the target
 *   - `endure`                     → never spat on
 * `win_argument` is intentionally absent: the sim has no resolved outcome to
 * read (08 §3), and pretending otherwise would ship a fake verdict.
