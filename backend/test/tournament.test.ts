/**
 * The tournament driver (08 §5, §7, D1–D8).
 *
 * `tickTournament` takes `now` as an argument precisely so this suite can drive
 * a whole season — 5 trial DAYS of 2–3 contests each, then two semifinals, a
 * final, a champion and a rollover — in milliseconds without a real clock and
 * without a running sim.
 *
 * Two clock rules, and losing either is how this suite went stale once already:
 *
 *  - **anchor the season to the test clock.** `createInitialWorld()` stamps
 *    `season.startedAt` with the *real* clock (world.ts:115). Driving a
 *    synthetic `T0` against that anchor puts every in-game day at season
 *    position 249 — well past the trial days — so the phase machine reads
 *    trials as knockouts, the roster as a bracket, and `retireResolved`'s
 *    knockout shield swallows every card. `beforeEach` re-anchors to `T0`.
 *  - **pass the test's own `now`** to every clock-taking call
 *    (`registerForContest`, `seasonPhase`) instead of letting it default to
 *    `Date.now()`, which is a different day entirely.
