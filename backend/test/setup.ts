/**
 * Hermetic persistence for the backend suite (wired in vitest.config.ts via
 * `setupFiles`).
 *
 * The suite must never read or write the repo's data/town.json: that is a live
 * save (herd 64/64 full, `_visited` left as `{}` by an old Set round-trip), and
 * any assertion touching it passes or fails by accident of its contents.
 *
 * Rules:
 * - A DATA_PATH set by the caller (CI, or the "full pasture" gate run) is
 *   respected as-is — the suite then deliberately runs against that town.
 * - Otherwise each test file gets its own throwaway town under the OS temp
 *   dir, seeded from createInitialWorld(): a small valid world (8 herd, far
 *   from maxHerd 64), so snapshot/fork tests always have a parent and room to
 *   grow, while never being "full".
 * - Nothing under the repo's data/ directory is ever written; saves land in
 *   the temp file (plus its .backup.json sibling) like any other DATA_PATH.
